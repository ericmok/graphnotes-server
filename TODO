    ☐ Username, Password minLength validation @created(19-11-06 13:41)
    ☐ Implement logging of Auth errors but make it opaque to end users @created(19-11-10 18:15)
    ✔ Graphql Auth directives @created(19-11-16 20:22) @done(19-11-17 15:20)
    ☐ Test directives @created(19-11-17 15:20)
    ☐ Change user references from username to ID? @created(19-11-28 17:15)

Graphs:
    ☐ Add automatically generated graph slugs @created(19-11-16 18:44)
    ☐ Use human readable ids for slugs @created(19-11-16 18:44)
    ✔ Graph.vertices @created(19-12-17 13:46) @done(19-12-19 00:58)
    ☐ Add vertex.inArcs, vertex.outArcs, vertex.inNeighbors, vertex.outNeighbors endpoints @created(20-01-02 21:39)
    
Database:
    ☐ Handle when server starts with no database @created(19-11-06 09:10)
    ☐ Guard test database clearing in non dev mode? @created(19-11-06 09:11)
    ☐ Restart database in testing @created(19-11-06 09:11) @started(19-11-06 09:11)
    ☐ Handle database connections when server starts/restarts and AlreadyHasActiveConnectionError @created(19-11-06 09:12)
    ✔ Change Errors to ApolloErrors @created(19-11-06 09:49) @done(19-11-06 10:36)
    ☐ Make tests faster. Database syncing in tests seem to be slow. @created(19-11-10 14:39)
    ☐ Ramdisk postgres? @created(19-12-17 13:46)

Refactors:
    ☐ Should testQueries be co-located with resolvers? @created(19-11-16 18:43)
    ☐ DRY up test server setup @created(19-11-16 18:43)
    ☐ Figure out where auth and permissions are located. Co-locate auth services and endpoints? @created(19-11-16 20:15)
    ☐ Refactor names of services and resolvers @created(19-11-28 17:15)
    ☐ Refactor test queries @created(19-12-17 13:46)
        Reduce cyclomatic complexity
    ☐ Use Repositories instead of Services? @created(19-12-17 13:47)
    ✔ Resolve id by encoding _id @created(19-12-17 13:48) @done(19-12-17 13:48)
        This involved adding mappers settings to codegen config, changing GQL interfaces, changing resolvers
        Needed to do this to handle addition of Graph.vertices        

General:
    ☐ Add Node endpoint in the style of Relay Graphql spec @created(19-11-19 15:54)

    ☐ Add on delete cascade @created(19-12-19 00:58)
    ☐ Fix typeorm manager being accessed outside of context @created(19-12-19 01:03)
